			Geisha is probably a familiar concept for everyone, but in Kyōto, geisha is not called geisha. Geisha is actually the name used in Tōkyō region. The difference is minor, but it's important to clarify the terminology before dashing forward with the subject.It also needs to be said that there's a lot of confusion with the terms if you browse through various web sources. We had to go through a little trouble to finally find reliable looking sources, which agreed on the terms. But if we still got ourselves confused, feel free and kind enough to set us straight. 
		</p>
		<p>
			So about Kyōto then. What we finally found out is that a geisha in Kyōto is supposed to be called geiko. Geiko is used in many enough places that we doubt here's anything wrong, but the proper meaning is rather the source of debate. This is because there is another term, which might be more important to know and that is maiko. Geiko is full fledged professional of the art and maiko still under studies on a path to become geiko. There's a lot we don't know about the rest of the terms, but these two are enough to make the following text clear.

			It's another matter entirely how you recognice geiko and maiko from each other and especially from all the fake ones littered around the tourist regions of Kyōto. To be honest, the rule is quite simple. If you haven't done any effort to get a glimpse of these mysterious figures, you most likely haven't seen one. Real geiko or maiko are not that common that you would see them randomly around the city. Instead tourists and other visitors like to dress fancy and put on kimonos. Some go a little further and even add make-up to finish the camouflage. 
		</p>
		<p>
			So what to do to differenciate the fake ones from the real deal? As surprising as it might be, look down. If you see a cheap looking pair of plastic flip-flops or sandals, you've just unveiled a phoney. If, on the other hand, you see stylish and high, wooden sandals, there's a chance you've met or at least seen a real geiko or maiko. What to do then, if you burn with the desire to take a photo. Calm down, show some respect and allow them to continue on their path. You'll have your chance of getting a photo or two if you plan a little ahead. You don't need to make a jerk out of yourselves. There's plenty enough of those types around.

			Our intention is to write here hints, which would help you, the readers, to find a peaceful way of having a glimpse of the representatives of this mysterious and very Japanese profession. We hope you would do the effort on your part to make it pleasant or at least as unobtrusive as possible for the maikos and geikos. First of all, there are plenty of ways to see maikos without having the need to hunt them don't on the strees. Why just maiko, you might ask. Well, maikos are a rare breed but geikos, they are true ghosts. And you wouldn't really care if you saw one or the other. Maikos dress according to the typical idea of geisha. Geikos, on the other hand, dress more plainly and humble. Chances are that you'd actually rather take a picture of a maiko than a geiko. So, how to do it easy?

			There are many events where maikos show their traditional arts. Some are free and some cost only the entrance fee to a temple. It's hard to recommend any single event because it really depends on the time of the year you visit the city. But one event is a certainty if you are lucky enough with the time of the month. Every 3rd Sunday of each month there is a free show of maiko dance at the museum of traditional crafts in Kyōto. We really REALLY recommmend to take part. When we visited there, there was three performances with 45 minute gaps between them. We sat through two of them and they were both different and enchanting. After each performance you also get a chance to take photos of the maiko. This is by far the easiest way to get the hard-sought photo. And I presume it's also far less annoying for the maiko. As a plus, the museum might also be the best place to buy traditionally grafted products in the city of Kyōto. So, if that's something you like, there's no reason to skip this event.

			Second option worked both times we did it, but this is a little questionable. There is a spot where you are quite likely to see at least maikos on a certain time of the day. But this is also a place where you'll see plenty of jerks. Really, don't act like them. Don't stop the maikos, don't touch them, don't surround them. You'll have plenty enough chances to get a nice shot if only the place wasn't so full of idiots who spoil it for everyone. Therefore we are a little doubtful if it's a good thing to share this hint. If you are the decent kind, you might also get a bad feeling visiting there. So, we recommend this only if you're desperate and then also, think twice or thrice how you are representing yourself.
