		Our long time dream has been to visit Inari. And now it came true, although not as far north as we thought the place to be. So, if you plan to visit Inari in Finland, we would give a warm recommendation to give the Japanese version a try. Of course, for completely different reasons. :)

		Essentially, Inari is a Japanese kami ("god") of foxes, fertility, rice etc. but also of prosperity and worldly success. Fushimi Inari-taisha is the main shrine dedicated to Inari. The shrine itself was quite interesting, but the main attraction is definitely Inariyama (Inari mountain), which you can access from the shrine. The mountain has a lot of hiking tracks and lots and lots and LOTS of torii (the red gates which are so typical to Japan). It is not that high, but it certainly takes some time to climb and some paths can be quite steep and demanding.

		The path starts with a thick tunnel of torii. This was very peculiar to us -- and to hundreds of other people. It was a little hard to get a nice photo without blocking the flow of people. If you go through pictures of Kyoto, this is one of the most common thing to see along with the golden pavilion. 

		Since Inari is the patron of foxes, there was fox statues all around the mountain. As an interesting addition, there was an opportunity to draw a face for a wooden fox head. These pieces of art were then hung on a wall for everyone to see. We didn't catch from where you could get the head and how much it would have cost us, so we didn't try it out ourselves.

		There are many separate small and interesting shrines all over the path, but we were not sure if it's appropriate to enter them. Since we saw people doing just this, we gave up the courtesies and went along. :)

		There were a few very scenic views over Kyoto along the path which you shouldn't miss. Here are a few examples to give you an idea.

		The main paths were very easy to walk although they might get crowded with people. We managed to choose a less popular path to climb up the mountain and there was hardly anyone, although the day was a warm Sunday and there was definitely tons of people climbing the mountain.

		All in all the day was one of the best we had in Japan. The weather was first time very pleasant and turned out to be very warm in comparison to the previous days. In the end we were walking in t-shirts after getting to the top while the locals hardly even opened their thick jackets. What show offs. 

		Before reaching Fushimi Inari-taisha, we ate in a small restaurant along the way. The food was very good and the cook/owner showed us how to manage with the grill in the middle of our table. We tried Yakisoba with different fillings and one of our group dared to be different with Okonomiyaki.
