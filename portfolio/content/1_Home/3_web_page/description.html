	While it might be tempting to emphasise some 3D model, art work or game I've put on the page, I must say that the biggest single work must have been the construction of the page itself. I've aimed to create a static page for easier content management. That means there is no web server magic happening here.

	 I also didn't need a database to access content. The content is placed into a cloud and indexed for easy access.
