	I am a meager soul living in the cold peripheria we locals like to call Finland. More precisely a few hundred kilometers below the Arctic Circle. This means we enjoy periods of extreme dark and light during the year, enjoy some fantastic Northern Lights and try to survive against impossible odds given by nature. Once we get a break from the glutches of harsh winter cold (it's quite nice actually), we are haunted by the endless hordes of summer-born mosquitoes. Needless to say, after fighting all year long, one's sanity is put under constant test and one needs to direct that frustration to work of any sort. Some build summer cottages and maintain them against all hardships, others tune cars or burn stress in mind-boggling sets of extasy. And this humble page here is a part of my survival strategy, which you are the most welcome to enter. So grap a cup of coffey, tea or hot chocolate and come further in!

	What you witness here is a collection of my works which I would like the world to see. The page itself is still under construction but as you decent deeper into each category, you will be presented with a selection of snapshot images, presentation videos and even fully playable games. It all depends of course on the capabilities of your device. While the page is being build to be as mobile friendly as possible, some feature are just not supported by mobile browsers. These include flash videos and Unity WebGL builds (i.e. games for browser). I aim to add some screencaptures to compensate the loss, but for the time being, its only on the drawingboard.
