	Here we have a project started in 2012. The topic might be familiar to some of you. It's the Enterprise of the later movies of Star Trek TNG (The Next Generation). I think the model number was E. Yeah. Once a trekkie, always a trekkie.

	The animation is the final work for a modeling course but the model has seen some development during the years. The topology design is still far from pretty and the model has some desperate need for nice textures, but it slowly going forward.

	The animation is ok. It has some unpolished moments, but it does its job. Mostly I think the animation misses the trekky flash at the end of the jump. Something to look forward to doing once there's free time from other projects.
