<p>
	Here is a collection of questions. The topics range from general information about me to how to navigate the page. For those with too much time on their hands or too curious for their own good.
</p>

<h2>Who?</h2>

<p>
	I am a hopelessly creative software developer. I love to get my hands dirty with different projects and I have a few of them going on all the time. Games and storytelling are a passion of mine and I also adore graphics and visual arts in general. On this page, I've arranged a selection of my projects which are presentable on a digital medium such as the Web.
</p>

<h2>Where?</h2>

<p>
	Currently, I am situated in Oulu, the belly button of Finland. It is more precisely a few hundred kilometers below the Arctic Circle. This means that I and my fellow cohabitants are lucky enough to experience periods of extreme dark and light throughout the year. Also, since Oulu is situated next to the seashore, we have plenty of chilly wind to endure â€” most often from the direction you're heading in. For some reason, people still like to bicycle and I count myself as one of them. In full honesty, I have yet to see a city or a town where bicycling is as easy as in Oulu.

	<!--We also occasionally enjoy fantastic Northern Lights and win some hockey cup or F1 championship, but mostly we spend our time trying to survive against the impossible odds given us by nature. Once we get a break from the clutches of harsh winter cold (it's quite nice actually), we are haunted by the endless hordes of summer-born mosquitoes. Needless to say, ones mental state might start to fracture under such hazardous environment and one needs to direct that frustration to some meaningful activity or work of any sort. Others build summer cottages and maintain them against all hardships while their blood is sucked try, others tune cars and melt their senses with mind-boggling tunes designed for the lowest levels of hell, and others get creative in different ways. This meager page is a part of my survival strategy. -->

<h2>What?</h2>

<p>
	What you witness here is a collection of things I've done during the years. They are here for the world to see. Don't be shy to peek. I'm not shy to share.
</p>
<p>
	The page itself is past its infancy but changes are likely to occur. Also, some of the content screams for an update. Still, I hope this page gives you, at its current state, a glimpse of what I can do.
</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>
	To get started, you should aim to the top left of the page. From there you can access the page menu which contains different topics. Once clicked, the topics open sub-menus which lead to the actual samples of my work. Currently, the categories are divided by programs I've used, but this can change since the page and its contents are under constant development.
</p>
<p>
	As you descent deeper into each category, you will be presented with a selection of snapshot images, sample videos, and even fully playable games (or rather game prototypes). It all depends, of course, on the capabilities of your device. While the page is aimed to be as mobile-friendly as possible, some features aren't supported by mobile browsers. Most notably Unity WebGL builds (i.e. the games for the browser) might not load and will most definitely not function as intended. WebGL support has become better in recent years but it won't alleviate the fact that those games aren't built with mobile input in mind. If you manage to get a gamepad to work, feel free to share with me the secret.

	<!--I aim to add some screen captures to compensate the loss, but for the time being, its only on the drawing board.-->
