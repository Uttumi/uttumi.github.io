	Here is a collection of my LLM shenanigans. I utilized my TTRPG campaigns as testbeds for text, code, and image generation, and I'm always on the lookout for more tools to ease the burdens of the Game Master.

	Below I've arranged sets of Midjourney images and here is a <a href="https://uttumi.github.io/coriolis/character/">link</a> to my heavily homebrewed and interactive character sheet for Coriolis: The Third Horizon, or rather for its system the Year Zero Engine.

	I used Claude as an AI assistant for the page creation process and found it quite useful up to a certain point. If you are in a need of a web page and can stomach potentially messy CSS files, I encourage you to give Claude a go.

	I also created talents, skills, and equipment descriptions with Claude. Unfortunately, these are currently limited by Trello user restrictions since I've used Trello to organize my TTRPG projects. Who knows, maybe Claude and I will push our collaboration to the limits and create a Trello killer for the benefit of all GM-kind.
