	These pretty things are my own fan art for a project I'm doing with far better artists than me. As everyone can see, the characters are human-animal hybrids aka. furries. It's not a typical topic for my paintings and that's why I had to try it out. The first one (panda) is more representative of the style I prefer with my digital paintings. The next two are tests on doing a more simplified shading. It was fun to figure out how to use the new technique efficiently. There was a lot of work to keep the projects organized and easy to modify. I also got to play around with the layer blending modes.

	These paintings were done on Krita. I heard some recommendations of this free editor and wanted to try it out. After these paintings I was sold. So far I've managed to do all the same things with Krita as what I typically do with Photoshop. At least when talking about digital painting.
