	With this prototype I played a bit with gravity. I wanted to try creating gravity fields and that's what I got. It's also a test of 2D sidescroller controls in a freely rotating environment.

	The outcome works pretty well. I could improve some edge cases while climbing ladders and there's a few bugs I'm aware of. At the moment though I've been more focused on top down view, so this prototype has to wait for its turn.

	This demo works only with keyboard. Use arrow keys or WASD to move around and jump with space. But be careful where you jump! You might end up on a long journey through space.
