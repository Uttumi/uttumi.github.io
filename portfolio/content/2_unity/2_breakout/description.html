	A typical Breakout/Arkanoid clone. How elementary of me.

	I've been teaching game development for a few years by now and this is always the project I start with. That means a lot of Breakout games out there.

It has simple single axis movement and controls, some physics you could easily write on your own and a potential for a few sounds, animations etc.
