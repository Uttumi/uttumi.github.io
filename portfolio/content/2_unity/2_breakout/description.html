	A typical Breakout/Arkanoid clone. How elementary of me.

	I've been teaching game development for a few years by now and this is always the project I start with. That means a lot of Breakout games out there. It's one of the best games to show some basics of Unity and game programming in general. There's simple single axis movement and controls, some physics (which you could easily write on your own) and potential for a few sounds, animations etc.

	So it's nothing special, but I wanted to give you a chance to beat the level. After years of arduous battling, only one person has achieved the feat â€“ as far as I aware of. No, it's not me.
