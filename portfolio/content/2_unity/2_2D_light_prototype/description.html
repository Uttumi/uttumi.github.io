	Here we have a portion of a bigger game project. The first version was made with a team as big as 11 but it slowly diminished into a group of three. Now we are rebuilding the game into something better than what it was before. And this piece is a prototype of our brand new 2D lighting system.

	While the graphics and sounds are produced by other team members, all the code is done by me. I must admid that I'm a little bit proud how the light system turned out. There's still some features to add and the shadows need tuning but it's very efficient and precise.

	You can use keyboard and mouse and game controllers to test the prototype. Press ESC to see the keybinding and to change the control device. Unfortunately gamepad mappings are a bit broken in the WebGL build. I don't know the reason and I might not delve into it too much since the game is not aimed for browsers. Time to try good old keyboard and mouse if the gamepads don't want to co-operate.

	Be warned that I had to increase the memory demands of WebGL and the build might not work on every computer or browser.
