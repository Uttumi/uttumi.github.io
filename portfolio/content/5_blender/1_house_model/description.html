	It's a pretty accurate model of my current apartment and some of its furniture. Many things are still missing because I've mostly done the central pieces. Although Blender might not be the most handy program for planning furniture and yard arrangements, I've still found it extremely helpful. And I did learn a lot about modeling while doing this.
