	This is an ancient Super Melee clone. That means I did most of this stuff around the year 2013. It's been going forward sluggishly and mostly with the 3D models but I haven't actually done low poly versions of the models so the this game doesn't have them yet.

	The game needs quite a lot of renovation at its core since I used to get the hang of Unity. It is kind of playable although some update broke the damage system for the red ship. Still, you can enjoy the ship selection carousel. Yes, I am the most proud of it!

	If you don't know Start Control and Super Melee, the idea is to beat the other ship. There's two options to choose from. With the red ship you try to ram the opponent or bounce its energy balls back with your front shield. The green ship can shoot tracking energy balls. You can try a 2 player game or make both players AI to see how they manage.
