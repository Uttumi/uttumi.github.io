	Here you can try my first bigger game project on Unity. I've still been updating it slowly, but it needs quite a lot of renovation at its core. The game is quite playable, some recent update broke the damage system for the red ship, but you can at least enjoy the ship selection carousel. Yes, I am the most proud of it!
