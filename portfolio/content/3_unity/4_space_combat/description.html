	This is an ancient Super Melee clone. That means I did most of this stuff around the year 2013. It's been going forward sluggishly and mostly with the 3D models. I still haven't found the time to finalize the models and to make low poly versions them. So this demo contains only two very old models and there's a placeholder copy of one of them for testing the ship selection.

	If you don't know Start Control and Super Melee, the idea is to beat the other ship in a fair duel.

	There's two options to choose from. With the red ship you try to ram the opponent or bounce its energy balls back with your front shield. The green ship can shoot tracking energy balls. You can try a 2 player game or make both players AI to see how they manage.

	The game needs quite a lot of renovation at its core since I used the project to get the hang of Unity. It is kind of playable although at some point I managed to break the damage system of the red ship. Still, you can enjoy the ship selection carousel. I managed to make it quite functional. And you can try the melee even with the red ship. You just need to return the favour to your rival by bouncing back their shots.
