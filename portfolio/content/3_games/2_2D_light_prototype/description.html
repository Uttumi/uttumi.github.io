This was a portion of a bigger game project we did in OGL (Oulu GameLab). At its peak, we had a team as big as 11, but it dwindled into nothing by the end of the lab. I continue to work with my part of the project and slowly build the base of the game and its tools into something better than what we had before. This prototype presents the 2D lighting system of the game.

While the graphics and sounds are produced by the other team members, all the code is done by me. I must admit that I'm a bit proud, how the light system turned out to be. It needs some amount of tuning, but the system is very efficient and precise.

To test the prototype, you can use a keyboard and a mouse. You can even try gamepads. Press ESC to see the keybindings and to change the control device. Unfortunately, gamepad mappings have not been cooperating with the WebGL build. I don't know what is the problem and I do not plan to delve too much into it since the game is not aimed at browsers.
