I had already been working on a game flow and narration system based on the now abandoned Fungus  extension for Unity, and Bingwood was a perfect candidate for testing the system. The Fungus team had created a custom flowchart which in itself was a great addition to any project. Unity has been incapable at providing a robust solution for custom flowcharts even now. The true value, though, came from the flow structure that they had designed. The idea that Fungus had for the logical structure of branching narrative was, and might still be, far superior to anything available in the Unity Asset Store.

The issues I had with Fungus were essentially its action and variable handling. It was hard to implement your own actions into the system and the old ones were buggy. I've essentially rebuild the system to work on scriptable objects rather than being instanced within a Unity scene. All the data and execution handling has also been rewritten for simplicity and scalability. What's left is the flowchart view and the spirit.
