<b>Tales of Bingwood</b> is a retro point-and-click adventure with pixel-perfect graphics. It's a project of a good old colleague of mine, <b>Markus Tuppurainen</b>. I agreed to renovate his project for modern audiences and, at the same time, create tools that would help in creation of new game titles of similar kind.

The project has been on-going for quite a few years and is slowly approaching fruition. When it happens, we're sure the keep everyone posted.

I had already been working on a game flow and narration system based on now extinct Fungus extension for Unity and Bingwood was a perfect candidate for testing the system. 
</p>
<p>
The idea that Fungus had for the logical structure of branching narrative was far superior to anything available on Unity at that time. Since then I've essentially rebuild the system to work on scriptable objects rather than being instanced within a Unity scene. All the data and execution handling has also been rewritten for simplicity and scalability. What's left is the flowchart view, since Unity has been incapable at providing a robust solution for custom flowcharts, and the spirit.
