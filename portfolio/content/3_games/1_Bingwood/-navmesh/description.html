For Bingwood, we required an easily customizable navigation system. The old game had used navigation meshes and had implemented custom values for the vertices of the mesh. It was also prefered that the mesh was easy to edit manually from within Unity editor. To support all this functionality, it was the easiest to create our own navmesh solution.

The current system supports editing the mesh in Unity editor. The user can create new triangles by dividing outer edges into new triangles or by filling the region between three selected vertices with a triangle. The system supports navigation based on A* algorithm. It can handle holes inside the mesh and find closest points on the mesh based on user clicks.

All in all, the navigation system might be rudimentary, but it fits for our retro needs.
