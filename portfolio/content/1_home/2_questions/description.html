<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>
	I am a hopelessly creative software developer. I love to get my hands dirty with different projects and I have a few of them going all the time. Games and storytelling are a passion of mine and I also adore graphics and visual arts in general.
</p>
<h2>Where?</h2>
<p>
	Currently I am situated in Oulu, the belly button of Finland. It is more precisely a few hundred kilometers below the Arctic Circle. This means that me and my fellow cohabitants are lucky enough to experience periods of extreme dark and light throughout the year.

	<!--We also occasionally enjoy fantastic Northern Lights and win some hockey cup or F1 championship, but mostly we spend our time trying to survive against the impossible odds given us by nature. Once we get a break from the clutches of harsh winter cold (it's quite nice actually), we are haunted by the endless hordes of summer-born mosquitoes. Needless to say, ones mental state might start to fracture under such hazardous environment and one needs to direct that frustration to some meaningful activity or work of any sort. Others build summer cottages and maintain them against all hardships while their blood is sucked try, others tune cars and melt their senses with mind-boggling tunes designed for the lowest levels of hell, and others get creative in different ways. This meager page is a part of my survival strategy. -->

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>
	What you witness here is a collection of my works. They are here for the world to see. Don't be shy to peak. I'm not shy to share.

	The page itself is still in its infancy and under construction. While it's mostly bug free, some features are not yet implemented and changes are likely to occur. Also, I haven't had the time yet to prepare all the intended content for the page. The 3D models are quite fresh but the other stuff has some years on them. Still, I hope this page gives you, at its current state, a glimpse of what I can do.

	As you descent deeper into each category, you will be presented with a selection of snapshot images, sample videos and even fully playable games or rather game prototypes. It all depends of course on the capabilities of your device. While the page is being build to be as mobile friendly as possible, some feature are just not supported by mobile browsers. These include flash videos and Unity WebGL builds (i.e.games for browser). I aim to add some screen captures to compensate the loss, but for the time being, its only on the drawing board.
