	I am an artistically minded software developer who is very eager about games, graphics and visual arts in general. I am currently situated in Oulu, the belly button of Finland, which is more precisely a few hundred kilometers below the Arctic Circle. This means that me and my fellow cohabitants are lucky enough to experience periods of extreme dark and light throughout the year. We also occasionally enjoy fantastic Northern Lights and win some hockey cup or F1 championship, but mostly we spend our time trying to survive against the impossible odds given us by nature. Once we get a break from the clutches of harsh winter cold (it's quite nice actually), we are haunted by the endless hordes of summer-born mosquitoes. Needless to say, ones mental state might start to fracture under such hazardous environment and one needs to direct that frustration to some meaningful activity or work of any sort. Others build summer cottages and maintain them against all hardships while their blood is sucked try, others tune cars and melt their senses with mind-boggling tunes designed for the lowest levels of hell, and others get creative in different ways. This meager page is a part of my survival strategy.

	What you witness here is a collection of my works which I would like the world to see. The page itself is still under construction but as you decent deeper into each category, you will be presented with a selection of snapshot images, presentation videos and even fully playable games or rather game prototypes. It all depends of course on the capabilities of your device. While the page is being build to be as mobile friendly as possible, some feature are just not supported by mobile browsers. These include flash videos and Unity WebGL builds (i.e. games for browser). I aim to add some screen captures to compensate the loss, but for the time being, its only on the drawing board.
