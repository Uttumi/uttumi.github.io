	On the left, you can see different topics. Once clicked, the topics will open sub-menus which lead to actual samples of my work. Currently the categories are divided by programs, but in the future you might see something like Art, Animation, 3D models, Games etc. As the page and its contents are under constant development, these kind of changes are likely to happen.
