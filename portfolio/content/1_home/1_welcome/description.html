	I am a humble soul living in the cold periphery we locals like to call Suomi, but you might know it better as Finland and this is a collections of my works. And you, good sir or madam, are the most welcome to enter. So, grab a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate if that's your preference and come further in!

	You can see on the left the menu for selecting different categories. Please try it out. Currently the categories are divided into programs, but in the future you might see there something like Art, Animation, 3D models, Games etc. All this is still under consideration. The main categories will open sub-menus which contain more precise description and samples of my works.

	The page is still quite young, and while it's mostly bug free, some features are not yet implemented and changes are highly likely. Also, I haven't had the time yet to prepare all the intended content for the page. 3D models are quite new, but other stuff has some age on them. Still, I hope this page gives you, at its current state, a glimpse of what I can do.
