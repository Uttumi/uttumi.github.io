	<!-- I am a humble soul living in the cold periphery we locals like to call Suomi, but you might know it better as Finland. -->

	Welcome to my portfolio! This is a collection of projects which I humbly share with the world. Or with you at least.

	<!--And you, good sir or madam, are the most welcome to enter. So, grab a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate if that's your preference and come further in! -->

	To get started you should aim to the top left of the page. From there you can access the page menu which contains different topics. Once clicked, the topics will open sub-menus and those lead to the actual samples of my work. Currently, the categories are divided by programs I've used, but in the future you might see something like Art, Animation, 3D models, Games etc. As the page and its contents are under constant development, these kind of changes are likely to happen.

	But, without further ado, please come in. I hope you enjoy your stay!
