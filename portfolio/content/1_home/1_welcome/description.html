	<!-- I am a humble soul living in the cold periphery we locals like to call Suomi, but you might know it better as Finland. -->

	Welcome to my portfolio! This is a collection of the projects I've been working with. All you see here is still under testing and constant construction but I hope you get the idea. 

	<!--And you, good sir or madam, are the most welcome to enter. So, grab a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate if that's your preference and come further in! -->

	On the left, you can see different topics. Once clicked, the topics will open sub-menus which contain more precise descriptions and samples of my work. Currently the categories are divided by programs, but in the future you might see something like Art, Animation, 3D models, Games etc. It's constantly evolving.

<p>
	But, without further ado, please come in and browse through the categories. I hope you enjoy your stay!
