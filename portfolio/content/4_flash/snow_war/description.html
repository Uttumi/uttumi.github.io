Since the flash animation was done as a group work, I thought it proper to clarify my contribution.

Art - All done by me.
Animation - Roughly 50% done by me. Mostly the mid part slow motion and the flag at the end.

Story and the other elements were designed within in a small group but the basic concept and the choice of music (Scorponok - Steve Jablonsky) was form my initial idea.
