	When I started the project my idea was to practice using popular technologies to keep up with the latest trends. It was easy to start with jQuery and a couple of CSS libraries (SASS, Compass, etc.) since they were widely used during that time. In addition, I tried a few other JS frameworks. Bootstrap was part of the project for a while but I ditched it after noticing that the rigid layouts did not work well for my intended design. Customization was far more tedious than building the page with pure JS and CSS.

	Later, I got rid of jQuery as well. It was not because of the capabilities of jQuery. It worked really well. I made the decision merely because the modern ECMAScript versions were making the library redundant. It stayed as a good source of reference for a few features, but the library as a whole was becoming unnecessary. So I decided to remove it from the project. My motivation was that I wanted to practice using the new JS features since it would give me a better understanding of the technology. Sticking to whatever framework was popular at the given time seemed counterintuitive in the end. I did not want to chase after the ever-changing trends.

	Since I wanted to stay away from implementing a build process and aimed to use the latest JS features, the support for old browsers was going to be negligible. I look at you IE. I did not want to restrict myself to features that were introduced 5-10 years ago. Then again, I considered that the potential visitors are most likely the kind who prefer better-maintained browsers.
